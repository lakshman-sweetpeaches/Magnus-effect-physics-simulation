# Magnus effect physics simulation
This project is a physics simulation of the magnus effect, this phenomenon is often noticed in ball sports where the ball attains a curved trajectory because of the angular rotation of the ball and drag to form areas of high and low pressure, which results in this unique curved path.

The aim of this project is to simulate the trajectory taking into account:
- The drag and lift coefficient of the ball
- Density of the medium (Air in this case)
- Initial velocity (user set parameter)
- Angular rotation in all the 3 axis (user set parameter using a slider)

Then visualize the simulated trajectory also showing the trajectory of the ball in a vaccum as comparison.

This goal was achieved by using the simulation library [Vpython](https://github.com/vpython), below are some attached images of the simulations generated:
